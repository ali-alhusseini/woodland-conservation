# ![Website Logo](assets/images/logo.svg) Woodland Conservation Website
Woodland Conservation is a designated area situated in Nova Scotia, Canada. 
This website functions as a comprehensive platform encompassing information about the site, 
as well as detailing the range of services and activities available within its confines.

## Background
This is a group project for the course Software Engineering at Saint Mary's University. 
The website is designed for a conservation site and was implemented to have a clean 
design and easy to navigate. The project allowed us to improve our collaboration skills 
and become more proficient with `Git` and `GitHub` as well as learn more advanced `HTML`, `CSS`,
and `JavaScript.` We also explored new API's such as `Cloudinary`, `FormSpree` and others.
